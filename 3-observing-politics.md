# 3.Observing politics through the social power of algorithms
## Initial questions: What does the use of decision-making algorithms in public administration reveal about politics? What does “algorithmic governmentality” entail?

**Review**: 
This work is divided in two sections: the first explores the material power of algorithmic programs themselves. The second draws draws on the notion of ““how” of power” developed by philosopher Michel Foucault in Society must be defended (2004), his series of lectures at Collège de France. It establishes that the power of algorithms goes beyond the material effects they produce, and also lies in the discourse surrounding them: “algorithm” is not a neutral term, it stands for something in the social consciousness, and can be used as a “ kind of evocative shorthand for the power and potential of calculative systems that can think more quickly, more comprehensively and more accurately than humans.”
This article is the introduction to a special issue of the Information, Communication & Society journal on “The Social Power of Algorithms”. As such, a big part is devoted to the presentation and contextualization of the different articles of the issue. Its most interesting contribution is its observations on the power of the notion of algorithms and its use of Foucaldian theory. This reflexion could be enriched by more evidence from the field.
The idea of “power of the notion of algorithm” is very useful to explain why certain government agencies can decide to implement algorithms as a response to a particular problem, and why it can be perceived as beneficial despite a lack of proven efficiency. This hypothesis could be used as the basis for future ethnographic research.

**Review** : In this book, Virginia Eubanks adopts an ethnographic approach and explores 3 stories of decision-making algorithms in American public system, through socio-historical contextualization, observation and interviews with diverse actors: those who decided to use the algorithm, the fieldworkers using them, and the people they are making decisions about): a coordinated entry algorithmic system in Los Angeles, to match homeless people with the available resources; a family screening tool used by social services in Pittsburgh; a welfare tool to receive healthcare financial assistance in Indiana.
Through these stories and the analogy of the digital poorhouse, referring to the actual poorhouses that were common in the 19th century, the book makes the argument that our new, so-called “innovative” digital tools are “embedded in old systems of power and privilege” and are used the penalize, classify and criminalize the poor.
Throughout the book, part ethnography and part advocacy, Eubanks raises several crucial points explored in more depth by other works in this bibliography: first, that technological devices and systems can be used as smokescreens to hide the bigger political concerns, which can lead to unfair effects; second, the dangers caused by the discrepancy between what we want to measure and what data is used, which can lead to unfair biased effects. 
The case studies in the book are set in the USA, raising some issues that would be less relevant in European contexts, where political and social legacies are different, and data-protection legislations are stricter. Yet, Eubanks’ methodology and the remarks she makes on the links between technology, public service and the criminalization of “poor people” would be worth exploring in other countries, including European ones, in a comparative fashion.

Review: In this introduction to the book Gouverner par les instruments (Governing through instruments), Lascoumes and Le Galès focus on “instruments of public action”. Instruments are understood as “institutions”, i.e. rules and procedures governing the interactions and behaviors of actors and organizations. They include legal norms, fiscal tools, information instruments, etc.
The authors draw on Foucault’s theory of governmentality to explain how, with the rise of a new governmentality in the 16th century, based not on conquest but on organizing society through rationalizing and technicizing public action, instruments have become central to public action. Lascoumes and Galès elaborate on two hypotheses with regards to instruments and politics:
1.The instruments used reveal a certain theory of the relationship between the governing and the governed
2.Instruments are not neutral, and they produce specific effects independent of the initial objectives, and structure public action.
They also call out the so-called neutrality of instruments and point out that they can be used to depoliticize political issues. 
Lascoumes and Galès speak of instruments in general, and do not specifically address algorithms in public administration. However, their approach sheds light on the power and concerns of algorithms in public decision-making. Seeing algorithms as instruments opens a path for a research in sociology of public action, and a lens through which to observe what the newly found interest for algorithms can reveal of our current political regimes.
