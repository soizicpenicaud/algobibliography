**Abstract**: Algorithms have developed into somewhat of a modern myth. They “compet[e] for our living rooms” (Slavin 2011), “determine how a billion plus people get where they’re going” (McGee 2011), “have already written symphonies as moving as those composed by Beethoven” (Steiner 2012), and “free us from sorting through multitudes of irrelevant results” (Spring 2011). Nevertheless, the nature and implications of such orderings are far from clear. What exactly is it that algorithms “do”? What is the role attributed to “algorithms” in these arguments? How can we turn the “problem of algorithms” into an object of productive inquiry? This paper sets out to trouble the coherence of the algorithm as an analytical category and explores its recent rise in scholarship, policy, and practice through a series of provocations.

**Review**: Tarleton Gillespie is an affiliate associate professor in the Department of Communication and the Department of Information Science at Cornell, currently Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research. This chapter of the collection Digital Keywords presents a definition of the keyword “algorithm”, in which the author encourages social scientists to be “cognizant of the multiple meanings of algorithm as well as the discursive work the term performs” (p.17). The work explores the different facets of the concept and their implications in terms of how algorithms should be studied as objects of social science research: algorithm as trick, algorithm as synecdoche, algorithm as talisman, algorithm as a process.  
This article contributes a very useful, clear, easy-to-understand typology to comprehend the different facets of algorithms as a concept in the social sciences. Probably as it is meant as a short definition of algorithms (as part of the Digital Keywords collection), its scope remains general and theoretical. Its bibliography can be used as a point of reference to explore other works on the topic.
Its broadness is also its strength: its 4-part definition of algorithms offers a good framework to comprehend and classify the different issues related to algorithms in public administration.

**Review**: This article starts by reviewing the different forms analyses of algorithms take in the social sciences. It then argues that one needs to study algorithms in an empirical, contextual manner, considering them as embedded in socio-technical assemblages, and lists the research challenges associated with this perspective on algorithms. The last part of the work critically explores six methodological approaches to empirically study algorithms, listing the strengths and weaknesses of each, and calling for a combination of two or several methods: examining the pseudo-code and source code of the program, producing code and self-examining the processes, reverse engineering, interviewing designers or conducting an ethnography of a coding team, including management and institutional collaboration into the study (through a discursive analysis of documents, history of the project, communication…), examining how algorithms change the lives of users and how users shape them. 
Robert Kitchin is the principal investigator of a European Council funded-research project on the programmable city. In this article, he presents a thorough review of the epistemology and methodology challenges of researching algorithms, and proposes concrete solutions to study algorithms in context. In his review of past scholarship, he also synthesizes many different works to offer a typology of present-day analysis methods, which is a useful framework to comprehend and classify current research on algorithms.
This work is very valuable for a researcher in need to choose their methods to research and best comprehend the workings and power of algorithms. It also thoroughly breaks down the steps needed to go from an abstract, mathematical algorithm to the final socio-technical assemblage it becomes a part of, which is helpful for neophytes in need to understand what algorithms are.

**Review**: Starting from the observation that “algorithm” causes “terminological anxiety” across disciplines, this work argues that we must accept algorithms as polysemic and observable in different ways. It conceives of algorithms as unstable objects, enacted by the practices people use to engage with them and the goals that determine why they do so. The author, an anthropologist, explains that “just as my discipline's methods are poorly suited to determining the efficiency of an algorithm in asymptotic time, so the computer scientist’s are poorly suited to understanding the cultural situations in which algorithms are built and implemented.” The last part of the paper is devoted to the tactics that can be used to engage with algorithms ethnographically, drawing in part from Michel de Certeau’s work on “ethnography of infrastructure”. 
Nick Seaver is an assistant professor of Anthropology at Tufts University, where he also teaches in the Science, Technology and Society program. He draws from his own field research on music recommendation software, and from that of others, to reflect and offer answers to a crucial question in algorithm studies: their definition. 
This work offers a very clear explanation of why it is interesting to consider algorithms as having multiple meanings, which can also be used to explain why it is interesting to study algorithms ethnographically to people from other fields (such as the engineers in charge of technically implementing algorithmic programs). The tactics it presents for the ethnographic study of algorithms will also be useful for researchers involved with such research.

**Abstract**: Algorithms have developed into somewhat of a modern myth. On the one hand, they have been depicted as powerful entities that rule, sort, govern, shape, or otherwise control our lives. On the other hand, their alleged obscurity and inscrutability make it difficult to understand what exactly is at stake. What sustains their image as powerful yet inscrutable entities? And how to think about the politics and governance of something that is so difficult to grasp? This editorial essay provides a critical backdrop for the special issue, treating algorithms not only as computational artifacts but also as sensitizing devices that can help us rethink some entrenched assumptions about agency, transparency, and normativity.
